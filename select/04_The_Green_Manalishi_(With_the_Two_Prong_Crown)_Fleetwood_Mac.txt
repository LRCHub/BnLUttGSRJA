Now when the day goes to sleep
And the full moon looks

The night is so black
That the darkness cooks

Don't you come creeping around
Making me do things I don't wanna do

Can't believe that you need
My love so bad

Come sneaking around
Trying to drive me mad

Busting in on my dreams
Making me see things I don't want to see

'Cause you're the green manalishi
With the two pronged crown

All my trying is up
All your bringing is down

Just taking my love then slipping away
Leaving me here just trying to keep from following you
