[00:13.59] Bite my tongue, bide my time
[00:16.71] Wearing a warning sign
[00:19.90] Wait 'til the world is mine
[00:26.22] Visions I vandalize
[00:29.49] Cold in my kingdom size
[00:32.56] Fell for these ocean eyes
[00:45.06] 
[00:37.82] You should see me in a crown
[00:40.93] I'm gonna run this nothing town
[00:44.25] Watch me make 'em bow
[00:45.60] One by, one by one, one by, one by
[00:50.61] You should see me in a crown
[00:53.64] Your silence is my favorite sound
[00:57.00] Watch me make 'em bow
[00:58.34] One by, one by one, one by, one by one
[01:17.34] 
[01:04.52] Count my cards, watch them fall
[01:07.67] Blood on a marble wall
[01:10.92] I like the way they all
[01:16.24] Scream
[01:17.42] Tell me which one is worse
[01:20.43] Living or dying first
[01:23.61] Sleeping inside a hearse
[01:28.44] (I don't dream)
[01:35.94] 
[01:30.58] You say, "Come over, baby
[01:36.20] I think you're pretty"
[01:43.28] I'm okay, I'm not your baby
[01:48.88] If you think I'm pretty
[02:00.38] 
[01:54.35] You should see me in a crown
[01:57.54] I'm gonna run this nothing town
[02:00.79] Watch me make 'em bow
[02:02.04] One by, one by one, one by, one by
[02:07.31] You should see me in a crown
[02:10.19] Your silence is my favorite sound
[02:13.55] Watch me make 'em bow
[02:14.72] One by, one by one, one by, one by one
[02:33.72] 
[02:33.92] Crown
[02:35.94] I'm gonna run this nothing town
[02:39.08] Watch me make 'em bow
[02:40.44] One by, one by one, one by, one by
[02:45.68] You should see me in a crown
[02:48.44] Your silence is my favorite sound
[02:51.84] Watch me make 'em bow
[02:53.29] One by, one by one, one by, one by one
