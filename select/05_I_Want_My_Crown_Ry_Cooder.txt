In the dark of night the secret vote was cast
We drove the union down at last
My evil deeds have ruined the land
A house divided cannot stand
I want my crown, I want my crown
The working man has been cast down
I want my crown, I want my crown
Then the day dawned bright and hard
When I stole away the court of nine
The Judas men served the cause
And the sacred church of law is mine
I want my crown, I want my crown
Justice has been cast down
I want my crown, I want my crown
You love the gleaming war machine
Your hearts beat fast, your eyes on the prize
War without end, riches untold
Oil and God and your righteous pride
I want my crown, I want my crown
Peace on earth has been cast down
I want my crown, I want my crown
I'm going to sit here and watch your little world come tumbling down
I want my'crown, I want my crown
