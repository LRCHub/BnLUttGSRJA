Rub The Red Crown
Tie The Knot Of Veins

Red Crown
White Collar
Golden Tooth
Hang The Chandelier Of Bones

Rub The Red Crown
Wear A Purple Robe Of Meat

A Sparrow Flits His Feather
Like A Chain Of Bubbles
Soaking In Heat
Fucking In An Orgy
Of Primordial Undecidability

From Chaos To The Brain

I Am An Army Of Pulses
My Hard Skin Is A Flute
My Brawn Is A Catapult

Rub The Red Crown
Tie The Knot Of Veins
Rube The Red Crown
Hang The Chandelier Of Bones
